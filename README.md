# personal-shell
Creating a shell in C. This shell can do all commands a normal shell can, with some extra built-in commands for better functionality (Project for CS241). For my personal code, refer to `shell.c`. Everything else is code provided to us by the staff of CS241, and therefore is code that is not my property.
